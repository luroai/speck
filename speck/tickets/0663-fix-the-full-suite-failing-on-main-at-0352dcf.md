# 0663 · Fix the full suite failing on main at 0352dcf

**Status:** 📋 ready

## Problem
The full suite fails on main at commit 0352dcf (0352dcf8e6951e830369417c1b021781aa9e12ca). Failing tests:
- 0277 AC1–AC5: at every width, info buttons line up, sit clear of the values, match the controls, and names wrap only at _ or .

## Outcome
The full suite passes on main again.

## Acceptance criteria
1. Each of these tests passes on main again: 0277 AC1–AC5: at every width, info buttons line up, sit clear of the values, match the controls, and names wrap only at _ or ..
2. No test that passed before this change fails.

## Out of scope
- Changes the failing tests don't need.
